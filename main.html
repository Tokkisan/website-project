</pre>
<br/>
<h2 class = intro> Crafting in Final Fantasy XVI may seem like a daunting task that you'll feel is impossible to understand; with its: 
rotations, macros, craftminship/control/cp stats, and penta melding. It also doesn't help that there are 8 different crafters, and that you can specialize in 3 of them.
However there are a few sites that can alleivate most of the stress and confusion.</h2>

<!-- ffxivcrafting -->

<div class = center>
  <p>
<br><br><br>
    <a class = fflink href="https://ffxivcrafting.com/">FFXIVCRAFTING</a>
<br><br>
  </p>
  <div style = "display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;">
    <img class = ffxivcrafting src ='https://i.postimg.cc/nrYZgr1j/ffxivcrafting.png'/>

    <h3 style = "display:inline-block;"> FFXIVCRAFTING is one of the best way to manage your recipes. The website allows you
     to input multiple recipes and the amount wanted, then it shows you the total amount of ingredients needed with a hyper link to garland data..

<br><br>
     It comes in a checklist format to mark off materials that have been gathered, or calculate how much more is needed.
<br><br>
     The site also tracks levequests (which is a great way to level up quickly if you have a lot of gil) and which equipment is the best at the given level.

<!-- Garland Data -->

<div class = center>

 <p>
 <br><br><br>
     <a class = fflink href="https://garlandtools.org/db/">GARLAND DATA</a>
 <br><br>
 </p>

 <div style = "display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;">
    <img class = garland src = "https://i.postimg.cc/8ccssVwc/garland.png"/>

    <h3 style = "display:inline-block;"> Garland Data is a massive database filled with information on every item, quest, npc, etc...

    <br><br>

    When clicking on the ingredients needed on ffxivcrafting it will send the user to Garland Data. Then the user can see the different ways to
    gather a certain ingredient, be it buying it off the marketboard, GC seals, NPCS, etc...

    <br><br>
    If the ingredient is time gated, Garland Data will display when the item is avaliable; theres also a setting to setup an alarm noise when the ingredient
    becomes available to gather.

<!-- Universalis Market -->

<div class = center>
<p>
<br><br><br>
	<a class = fflink href="https://universalis.app/"> UNIVERSALIS</a>
<br><br>
</p>

 <div style = "display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;">
    <img class = univ src = "https://i.postimg.cc/6ppRgVzK/univeralis.png"/>

    <h3 style = "display:inline-block;"> "Universalis is a market board data site with crowd sourced information, based on mogboard."
    <br>
    -Univeralis website
    <br><br>
    
    FFXIV allows a player to travel to a different server within their data center and users can buy off of that server's marketboard. Each server
    has different prices that people place on items so it may be cheaper to travel to other servers to buy crafting materials. 
    <br><br>
    Thats where Univeralis comes in, it tracks each server's marketboard by using crowd sourced information. It may not always be accurate but it gives
    a good reference of how expensive an item may be on that specific server.

<!-- Teamcraft -->
<div class = center>
<p>
<br><br><br>
	<a class = fflink href = "https://ffxivteamcraft.com/search">TEAMCRAFT</a>
<br><br>
</p>
  <div style = "display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;">
     <img class = tc src = "https://i.postimg.cc/gj9GKrZ6/teamcraft.png"/>
  
     <h3 style = "display:inline-block;"> FFXIV TeamCraft is one of the best sites for crafters. It also has similar settings as FFXIV crafting with its list and alarms for
     for time gated nodes.
     <br><br>
     However its main focus is its crafting simulator and gear sharing ability. Many veterans post their penta meld gear so that others can copy their build.
     <br><br>
     (Penta melded gear is only people who are really into crafting as the stats gain is for master recipes and above)
